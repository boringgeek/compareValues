# compareValues

This example accepts two lines of input from STDIN
The first line consists of two integers separated by a space. The first integer is a total number of values that we wish to compare. The second number is the deviation we want to find
The second line consists of a series of integers separated by a space.

The desire is to count the total number of integers whos are wtihin the specified deviation
Additionally, the desire is to minimize the computational time complexity as best you can

That being said, this may not be the most efficient way to do this so, by all means, let me know if you there is a better way.
